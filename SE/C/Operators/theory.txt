what is operators in c?

Operators are used to perform operations on operands. C supports various types of operators, including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, bitwise, and others.

num1 = 10
num2 = 20
total = num1 + num2

Operators : =, +
Operands : num1, num2, total

Common operators in C:

1. Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, % (modulus)
2. Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
3. Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
4. ++ (increment), -- (decrement)
5. Logical operators: && (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT)
6. Bitwise operators: &, |, ^ (bitwise XOR), ~, << (left shift), >> (right shift)
7. Ternary operators: ?: (conditional operator)

Note: C does not have built-in support for user-defined operators. You can create custom operators by defining macros or functions. However, this is not recommended as it can lead to complex and difficult-to-maintain code. Instead, use standard operators provided by the language.


// A B C
// T T T
// F T T
// T F T
// T T f
// F F F
