history of c programming?

The C programming language originated in the early 1970s, developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs as an evolution of the B language, which itself was derived from BCPL. C gained prominence when it was used to rewrite the Unix operating system in 1973, making it portable across various hardware platforms. The language was standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1989, known as ANSI C or C89, followed by the C99 standard in 1999, which introduced features like inline functions and variable-length arrays. Further updates came with the C11 standard in 2011, adding multithreading support, and the C18 standard in 2018, which focused on bug fixes. C's efficiency and flexibility have influenced many modern programming languages, and it continues to be widely used in systems programming, embedded systems, and applications requiring high performance.
