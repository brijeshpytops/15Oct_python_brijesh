What is identifiers in c?

Identifiers are used to name variables, functions, classes, and other entities in a program.

Identifiers rules:

1. They must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
2. They can contain letters, digits, or underscores.
3. They are case-sensitive (e.g., myVariable and MyVariable are different identifiers).
4. They cannot be a reserved keyword (e.g., int, float, double, etc.).
5. You can not use special symbols. (e.g., !,@,#, $, %....)
6. Identifiers should not start with a digit.
7. White-space are not allowed (e. g.,  first name, First name)


Examples:

- myVariable
- my_variable
- MyVariable
- _myVariable
- my_1Variable
- myVariable1
- myVariable2
- level_1
- level_2


- 1myVariable
