What is datatypes in c?

Datatypes are used to specify the type of data that a variable can hold. C supports various data types such as:

1. Integer (int): Represents whole numbers. [10, 45, -45]
2. Floating-point (float, double): Represents decimal numbers. [10.5, 3.14, -2.71828]
3. Character (char): Represents single characters. ['a', 'b', 'C']
4. Boolean (bool): Represents true or false values. [true, false]
5. String (string): collection of characters in " ["brijesh"] <- not supported by C

Note: C does not have built-in support for user-defined data types. You can create custom data types by defining structures or unions. However, this is not recommended as it can lead to complex and difficult-to-maintain code. Instead, use standard data types provided by the language.
